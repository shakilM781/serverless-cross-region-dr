Highly Available and Resilient Serverless Application with DR Strategy.
ðŸš€ What happens when your API goes down in one region?
In this project, I simulated exactly that scenario by building a serverless, cross-region disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA) architecture on AWS.

ðŸ”¹ The Challenge:
APIs deployed in a single region risk downtime if that region experiences issues. For global users, this could mean service interruptions and unhappy customers.
ðŸ”¹ My Approach:
â€¢	Designed DynamoDB Global Tables to replicate data across us-east-1 and us-west2.
â€¢	Built Lambda functions for reading/writing data into DynamoDB.
â€¢	Exposed them through API Gateway endpoints (/read and /write).
â€¢	Configured Amazon Route 53 for DNS-based Failover:
o	Primary Region: API Gateway in us-east-1.
o	Secondary (failover) Region: API Gateway in us-west2 (activated automatically on 5xx errors).
ðŸ”¹ Results & Takeaway:
â€¢	The system stayed resilient and always-on, when the primary region simulated a failure, traffic instantly failed over to the secondary region without users noticing downtime.
â€¢	With DynamoDB Global Tables, both regions stayed in sync, guaranteeing data consistency during failover.
â€¢	I proved that by combining serverless services (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Route 53) you can achieve enterprise-level disaster recovery and high availability without managing servers.
